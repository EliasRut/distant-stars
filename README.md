# Distant Stars - A scifi coding problem story
## The story
The year is 2722. Humanity has finally reached the stars and settled on foreign planets.

Sadly, it brought JavaScript with it.

You were on a mission to scout out the Simia Prime system when your ship was caught in a solar 
flare, causing your main computer to glitch out and keeping your ship drifting dead in space.

A quick check shows that most of your ships core programming is still good, but several functions
across different systems have been erased. You tried to load the backup, but that failed too.

The only way to get out of this situation is to rewrite the missing functions one by one, get all 
critical systems online, make sure that your deflector shield is updated to handle the next solar 
flare and figure out what caused the flare in the first place.

## How to proceed
This is a repository of narrated coding problem in JavaScript, targeted at beginning software
engineers. It is intended to be accompanied by the story, instructions and guidance you will find
on the following pages:
